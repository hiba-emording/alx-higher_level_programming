## STARTED WITH PYTHON
### PROJECT NUMBER 6

# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This project contains Python class implementations focusing on square manipulation and validation.

## Overview
This set of Python files represents a progression of tasks to create and manipulate square objects using classes and objects.
Each file corresponds to a specific task, building upon the previous one to introduce new functionalities and validations.

## Scripts
1. **My first square**
    - File: `0-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square defining a square.

2. **Square with size**
    - File: `1-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a private size attribute and instantiation with size.

3. **Size validation**
    - File: `2-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square validating size input with exceptions for non-integer and negative values.

4. **Area of a square**
    - File: `3-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a method returning the current square's area.

5. **Access and update private attribute**
    - File: `4-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with properties for retrieving and setting private attributes.

6. **Printing a square**
    - File: `5-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a method to print the square with `#` characters.

7. **Coordinates of a square**
    - File: `6-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a position attribute and validation for a tuple of two positive integers.
