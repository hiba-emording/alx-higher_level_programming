## STARTED WITH PYTHON
### PROJECT NUMBER 6

# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

This project contains Python class implementations focusing on square manipulation and validation.

## Overview
This set of Python files represents a progression of tasks to create and manipulate square objects using classes and objects.
Each file corresponds to a specific task, building upon the previous one to introduce new functionalities and validations.

## Scripts
1. **My first square**
    - File: `0-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square defining a square.

2. **Square with size**
    - File: `1-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a private size attribute and instantiation with size.

3. **Size validation**
    - File: `2-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square validating size input with exceptions for non-integer and negative values.

4. **Area of a square**
    - File: `3-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a method returning the current square's area.

5. **Access and update private attribute**
    - File: `4-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with properties for retrieving and setting private attributes.

6. **Printing a square**
    - File: `5-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a method to print the square with `#` characters.

7. **Coordinates of a square**
    - File: `6-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square with a position attribute and validation for a tuple of two positive integers.

8. **Singly linked list**
    - File: `100-singly_linked_list.py`
    - Description: Python classes Node and SinglyLinkedList defining a node of a singly-linked list and a singly-linked list. 

9. **Print Square instance**
    - File: `101-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square that defines a square, including a method to set printing of a Square instance equivalent to `my_print()`.

10. **Compare 2 squares**
    - File: `102-square.py`
    - Description: Python class Square that defines a square, including methods enabling usage of Square instances with logical operators based on the square area.

11. **ByteCode -> Python #5**
    - File: `103-magic_class.py`
    - Description: Python function matching exactly a provided bytecode.
